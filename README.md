However, this approach has a few significant drawbacks:
Performance: It would force us to call collectionView.indexPath(for:) for each view inside the loop. These are expensive lookups compared to the optimized indexPathsForVisible... methods, which provide the index paths directly.
Loss of Context: When dealing with supplementary views, we lose the kind information (header vs. footer). This makes looking up their indexPath ambiguous and complex.
Hidden Complexity: The simplicity of the array concatenation hides the complexity, which is then moved inside the processing loop, making it harder to maintain.
Recommendation:
The current implementation, which builds a [IndexPath: UIView] dictionary, is the correct and most robust solution. We should definitely keep it.
Here's the code block for reference:
Generated swift
// 1. Collect visible cells
var viewsToProcess: [IndexPath: UIView] = [:]
for indexPath in collectionView.indexPathsForVisibleItems {
    if let cell = collectionView.cellForItem(at: indexPath) {
        viewsToProcess[indexPath] = cell
    }
}

// 2. Collect visible headers
let visibleHeaderIndexPaths = collectionView.indexPathsForVisibleSupplementaryElements(ofKind: UICollectionView.elementKindSectionHeader)
for indexPath in visibleHeaderIndexPaths {
    if let headerView = collectionView.supplementaryView(forElementKind: UICollectionView.elementKindSectionHeader, at: indexPath) {
        viewsToProcess[indexPath] = headerView
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Swift
This approach is superior for the following reasons:
Direct Association: It correctly maintains the IndexPath -> UIView relationship from the start.
Efficiency: It avoids costly lookups inside the loop by leveraging UICollectionView's optimized methods.
No Ambiguity: When iterating (for (indexPath, view) in viewsToProcess), we have all the data we need immediately, keeping the core logic clean and straightforward.
