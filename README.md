"The root cause is a race condition in the View for visible cells. An asynchronous CustomImage fetching task is being canceled when the cell is recycled, but the cancellation logic executes after the image has already been successfully fetched. This results in the completion handler discarding a valid image because it incorrectly assumes the task failed."
â€¢ Fix:
"The fix is to enhance the validation within the completion handler. We now check that the task is still active by verifying task.isCancelled is false before applying the image. Additionally, we confirm that the cell is still configured for the intended image URL, preventing both the discard of a valid image and the misapplication of an image to a recycled cell."
