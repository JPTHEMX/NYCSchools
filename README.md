Thank you for asking. To maximize my effectiveness and success, leveraging my proven ability to efficiently solve complex problems on higher-impact work is key. I consistently deliver solutions for challenging technical issues, including major refactoring, often in condensed timelines, improving [stability/performance]. I also contribute by mentoring and guiding colleagues. Given this track record, to ensure my continued growth and success here, I'm seeking opportunities to take ownership of or lead more complex technical initiatives. I believe excelling in these types of roles is the natural next step, and I'd like to discuss how demonstrating success in these areas aligns directly with opportunities for promotion.
